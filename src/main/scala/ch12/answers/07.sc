/** It’s easy to get a sequence of pairs, for
  * example:

val pairs = (1 to 10) zip (11 to 20)

Now, suppose you want to do something with
such a sequence—say, add up the values. But
you can’t do

pairs.map(_ + _)

The function _ + _ takes two Int parameters,
not an (Int, Int) pair. Write a function
adjustToPair that receives a function of
type (Int, Int) => Int and returns the
equivalent function that operates on a pair.
For example, adjustToPair(_ * _)((6, 7)) is 42.

Then use this function in conjunction with map
to compute the sums of the elements in pairs. */




def adjustToPair(fun: (Int, Int) => Int) = (x: (Int, Int)) => fun(x._1, x._2)
